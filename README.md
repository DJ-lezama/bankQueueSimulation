# Bank Queue Simulation
This program simulates the queue of a bank with 4 cashiers for customer service. Each client (cliente) has a specific ID, while every cashier (caja) has a respective number and can either be busy or free to get a new client. 

The bank works 8 hours straight, four seconds in the program represent an hour, and each client can meet with a bank clerk for a certain amount of time generated randomly from 1 to 10 seconds.

The Poisson distribution will generate a random number of clients arriving at the bank each hour. The program will show how the queue moves and how many clients each cashier has met with.
